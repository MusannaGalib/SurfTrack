# This is the 'requirements.txt' file for the Python project.
# It lists all the external Python packages (dependencies) the project needs.

# The purpose of this file is to ensure that anyone who sets up the project
# has all the necessary dependencies installed. This aids in maintaining
# consistency across different development environments.

# To install these dependencies, one can run the command:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# This command uses pip, the Python package manager, to install all listed packages.

# Listed Dependencies:
# ---------------------

subprocess
os
time
MATLAB==2022a

# Note on 'os' Module:
# ---------------------
# The 'os' module is a built-in module in Python and does not need to be installed separately.
# It is available by default in all Python environments. Therefore, it's generally unnecessary
# to include it in the 'requirements.txt' file. However, if needed, it can be included here.
#os
